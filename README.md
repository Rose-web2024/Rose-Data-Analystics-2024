Python (Pandas) Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! This collection highlights my expertise in data analysis and storytelling using Python, with a focus on working with the Pandas library. Each project demonstrates my ability to explore datasets, perform statistical analyses, and derive meaningful insights to inform decision-making.

🔍 About
This repository features a range of data analysis projects where I used Pandas to explore datasets, identify patterns, and test hypotheses. My approach involves exploring and transforming data, performing in-depth analyses, and effectively communicating the results.

📁 Projects
1. Outlier Detection and Statistical Analysis
Used statistical methods to identify and handle outliers in datasets.
Explored relationships between variables and assessed data quality.
Generated visualizations to communicate statistical findings.
2. Filtering and Groupby for Data Exploration
Conducted data exploration using filtering, grouping, and aggregation techniques.
Analyzed key metrics across categories.
Delivered insights that helped uncover trends and patterns in the data.
3. Data Storytelling through Visualization
Combined Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create compelling data stories.
Built narratives around insights using visuals, trends, and metrics.
Focused on clarity.
4. Hypothesis Testing
Conducted hypothesis testing to validate business assumptions.
Provided data-driven evidence to guide strategic decisions.
